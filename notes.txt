Threads
----
Main thread
	Does all the work. Tasks are given to it through the messageQ
Door thread
	Just accepts connections and then hands them off
There is a thread for each peer?


Peers are causing:
	updates to the current transaction list
	updates to the validated list
	you to relay messages to other peers
	update your known node list
	check if a transaction is valid


Actualy I think this can all be in one thread. Commands to the app must be done by RPC.
